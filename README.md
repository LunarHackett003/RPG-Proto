# RPG-Proto
An area for me to prototype mechanics for an RPG-style game.

I've been really busy recently, and I've been trying to come to terms with the fact that I should work on something OTHER than a first person shooter for a change.
That's where this project comes in.

I have wanted to work on some kind of RPG-esque project.
I'd like this to, ideally, be a third person adventure game with combat, crafting and survival elements.
The player would be able to fight enemies, forge weapons, create buildings (maybe) and keep themselves alive in harsh conditions.
It would be in a fantasy setting, with monsters, bandits, dragons and mages.
The player will be able to learn magic, wield melee weapons and attack from afar with a bow/crossbow.
